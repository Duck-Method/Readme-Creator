# Readme-Creator
This repo is for the README creator project

## Description
This project is a CLI for creating a robust README file that includes questions, choices, and creation of the README file in markdown using the users inputs.

## Tutorial
This is the video tutorial for how to use the CLI. I used Lorem Ipsum in the example for the sake of ease.
